## Installation
For now, the installation is via github, with pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/leon-biner/amon.git. I will have to give you access though, or make it public.

## Usage
The program can be run from anywhere with the <amon> command. Add -h or --help after <amon> to see the different commands.
There are several commands, arguments, and flags. To see the help menu of a certain command, like <run>, type <amon run -h>.
